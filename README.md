# The Commitment

A contract requiring you to do one daily public OSS contribution, while allowing time for rest.

## With Time For Rest and Ledger

This document serves as a personal contract, hereinafter referred to as "The Commitment," between the undersigned party (hereafter "Contributor") and the public.

1. **Scope of Commitment**: The Contributor agrees to make at least one world-readable, individually copyrightable commit ("Commit") to a project (hereafter "Project") for which they hold the copyright, under an Open Source Initiative (OSI)-approved license, every day before midnight local time.
2. **Ledger Repository**: The Contributor shall maintain a ledger repository containing:

   1. The `optional-commit-days.csv` file (e.g., [`optional-commit-days.csv`](https://github.com/pojntfx/ledger/blob/main/optional-commit-days.csv)) documenting optional commit days
   2. Patch files organized in directories representing the repositories to which patches were submitted (e.g., `github.com/pojntfx/senbara.git/1758264958-example-message-0f08d14c83979b1ed40afa9c6f373cdd52de1528.patch`)

   Contributions to the ledger repository satisfy the daily Commit requirement when the Contributor is making contributions to repositories they do not own or cannot write to the main branch of (e.g., upstream open-source projects, experimental branches, or kernel patches). All standard Commit requirements apply to ledger repository contributions, including being world-readable and submitted before midnight local time. Duplicate commits to both the Contribtor's ledger repository and a project as defined in Scope of Commitment are discouraged to keep commit contribution graphs clean, but not prohibited. To simplify the process of submitting contributions to the ledger repository, the [`pledge`](./cmd/pledge) tool is recommended.

3. **Frequency and Timing**: The Commit is to be made daily, with the stipulation that each Commit must be completed and submitted before the stroke of midnight, according to the local time zone of the Contributor. Commits should preferably be signed with the Contributor's PGP key to allow verification of signing time by the remote hosting the Contributor's repositories.
4. **Optional Commit Days**: The Contributor is granted the option to forgo the Commit on the following occasions:
   1. For periods officially designated by the Contributor's employer, who shall not be the Contributor themselves, as vacation or sick leave, with protocol varying as follows:
      - **Vacation**: The start and end date must be documented and made world-readable in `optional-commit-days.csv`. This documentation must occur prior to the start of the vacation period, according to the local time zone of the Contributor.
      - **Sick Leave**: Same as for vacation, except the start and end date can be updated to include sick leave on the same day the leave is requested, according to the local time zone of the Contributor.
   2. On weekends, defined as Saturday and Sunday in the Contributor's local time zone.
   3. The Contributor is granted three days per calendar year to forgo the Commit without prior registration in `optional-commit-days.csv`, to accommodate any unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, the Contributor shall not be considered in breach of this Commitment due to failure to make Commits caused by circumstances beyond reasonable control (force majeure), including but not limited to: natural disasters, widespread power or internet outages, or serious accidents. In both cases, the Contributor should retroactively document affected days in `optional-commit-days.csv` when feasible.
5. **License Agreement**: The Contributor affirms that all Commits made under this agreement will be licensed under an OSI-approved license, ensuring that the contributions align with open-source principles and standards.
6. **Term of Agreement**: This Commitment remains in effect until formally revoked or amended in writing by the Contributor.
7. **Acknowledgement of Terms**: By signing below, the Contributor acknowledges and agrees to the terms outlined in this document, committing to the frequency and conditions under which the Commits to the Project are to be made.
